# Titanic_Dataset
Binary Classification Competition on Kaggle named Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.

I used Google Colab to run my jupyter notebooks.

Exploratory Data Analysis was preformed on the dataset, code can be found in file 'EDA_on_Titanic_Dataset.ipynb'.

Preprocessing the training and testing dataset, code can be found in file 'Preprocessing_Data_for_Titanic_dataset.ipynb'.

Tried a few models on the dataset, code can be found in file 'Trying_out_different_Models_on_Titanic_Dataset'.

Implemented a few Ensemble Techniques on the dataset, code can be found in file 'Ensemble_Methods_on_Titanic_Dataset'.

Performed hyperparameter tuning using RandomSearchCV, aode can be found in file 'Hyperparameter_Tuning_on_Titanic_Dataset'.

Thankyou
