# Titanic_Dataset

Binary Classification Competition on Kaggle named Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.

I used Google Colab to run my jupyter notebooks.

Exploratory Data Analysis was preformed on the dataset, code can be found in file 'EDA_on_Titanic_Dataset.ipynb'.

Preprocessing the training and testing dataset, code can be found in file 'Preprocessing_Data_for_Titanic_dataset.ipynb'.

Tried a few models on the dataset, code can be found in file 'Trying_out_different_Models_on_Titanic_Dataset'.

Implemented a few Ensemble Techniques on the dataset, code can be found in file 'Ensemble_Methods_on_Titanic_Dataset'.

Performed hyperparameter tuning using RandomSearchCV, code can be found in file 'Hyperparameter_Tuning_on_Titanic_Dataset'.

Final predictions are made using Hyperparameter tuned ensembles, code can be found in file 'Final_Prediction_using_Ensembles_on_Hyperparameter_Tuned_Models'.

You can get the dataset by extracting 'titanic.zip'.

'train_preprocessed' and 'test_preprocessed' were geterated after performing preprocessing and these preprocessed files are used in the next stages.

Thankyou...
